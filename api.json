      "full": "The Cú Sìth (pronounced \\\"coo-shee\\\"), also known as the Fairy Dog or Hound of the Sídhe, is a supernatural canine creature from Scottish Highland folklore, particularly associated with the Gaelic-speaking regions of Scotland. This massive, dark green hound with a shaggy coat is said to be as large as a small calf or yearling bull, and is one of the most feared omens in Highland tradition. Unlike mortal dogs that bark frequently, the Cú Sìth remains eerily silent as it moves through the misty glens and moorlands until it releases three terrifying barks that echo across the hills. According to tradition, those who hear the third bark before finding shelter are doomed to die of fright or will soon meet their death. The creature is intimately connected to the fairy mounds (sídhe) and the Otherworld, serving as both guardian and psychopomp, bridging the realm of mortals and the supernatural realm of Scottish fairy folk."
